# AnimalsCARE

The AnimalsCARE application developed aims to facilitate the animal adoption process from a shelter through an online platform. The website consists of two interfaces: one for users and one for employees. The application's functionalities are as follows:

- Registration and authentication: Users can create an account in the application and authenticate themselves to access the full range of features.

- Adding adoption posts: Employees can create and edit posts for animals available for adoption. These posts include information about the animal (name, species, breed, gender, age, description, medical conditions) and may also include a photo of the animal.

- Deletion of adoption posts: Employees can delete a post if there is an error.

- Completed appointment: Employees can cancel or delete an appointment if it has been successfully completed or not.

- Report of successfully completed appointments for the current year: The report is downloaded in .xls format.

- Real-time statistics: Statistics on the number of animals in the shelter and the number of adoptions.

- Viewing and searching existing posts: Users can view all available adoption posts and search for posts based on keywords.

- Interaction with posts: Users can interact with posts by scheduling a visit to the shelter for adoption or donation purposes. Employees can interact with posts by editing or deleting a post.

- Scheduling an adoption visit: Users can schedule a visit to meet and adopt an animal through the application.

- Scheduling a donation visit: Users can schedule a visit to assist the shelter with food or toys.

- Cancellation of an appointment: Users can cancel any scheduled appointment, which is saved in the "My Appointments" section of their profile.

- The "Home" page of the animal adoption website represents an essential platform for communication and conveying the shelter's values and messages to users. Through emotional content and appealing visual elements, this page aims to inspire compassion and provide relevant information, thereby encouraging responsible adoption and community support.
